Framework API
=============

The framework is organised as a small set of cooperating packages that expose
both Streamlit primitives (pages, widgets, orchestration helpers) and the
worker-side orchestration logic. Start here when you need to automate project
setup, build new nodes, or integrate with the AGILab distributor.

Core packages
-------------

- ``agi_env`` maps the current project into an ``AgiEnv`` object and provides the
  helper utilities relied upon by Streamlit pages (project discovery, dataset
  export, templating helpers, etc.).
- ``agi_node`` contains the base worker/node abstractions that run inside a
  cluster. Extend these classes when you need custom pipelines or want to add
  typed contracts around data exchange.
- ``agi_distributor`` bundles the orchestration layer responsible for installing
  apps, creating distributions, and delegating tasks to remote workers.

The detailed API reference for each package is available below.

Working with the API
--------------------

- Use ``agi_env.AgiEnv`` inside Streamlit pages or utility scripts to access the
  active project structure and configuration.
- Derive from ``agi_node`` base classes to implement new DAG steps or worker
  behaviours that can be shipped with your app bundles.
- Call into ``agi_distributor.AGI`` for programmatic install / get_distrib / run
  flows; this is the same surface area surfaced in the Orchestrate page snippets.

App structure conventions
-------------------------

- Every app bundles a manager module under
  ``src/agilab/apps/<app>_project/src/<app>/<app>.py`` and a worker module under
  ``src/agilab/apps/<app>_project/src/<app>_worker/<app>_worker.py``.
- Test coverage mirrors that split: ``test/_test_<app>_manager.py`` drives the
  manager entry points, ``test/_test_<app>_worker.py`` exercises the worker, and
  ``app_test.py`` orchestrates the combined flow.
- Instantiate managers with their validated args models (for example ``FlightArgs``).
  The convenience constructor ``BaseWorker.from_toml`` remains the recommended entry
  point for configuration-driven flows.

For end-to-end examples, browse ``src/agilab/examples`` to see how the packages
fit together in real projects.
