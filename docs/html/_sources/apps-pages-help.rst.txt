▶️ PAGE BUNDLES (apps-pages)
===============

AGILab can optionally launch **page bundles** (sometimes called “apps-pages”):
standalone Streamlit dashboards that complement the built-in workflow pages.

What is a page bundle?
----------------------

A page bundle is a small Streamlit project stored on disk and launched on demand
in its own Python interpreter:

- It lives under ``${AGILAB_PAGES_ABS}`` (default: ``src/agilab/apps-pages``).
- It is discovered when the directory contains a ``pyproject.toml`` whose entry
  point is ``src/<module>/<module>.py``.
- It can ship its own ``.venv`` (or ``venv``); otherwise Explore will fall back
  to the shared locations referenced by ``AGILAB_VENVS_ABS`` and
  ``AGILAB_PAGES_VENVS_ABS``.

Core pages vs page bundles
--------------------------

AGILab’s navigation treats both as “pages”, but they differ in runtime:

- **Core pages** (Home, Edit, Execute, Experiment, Explore) run inside the main
  ``AGILAB.py`` Streamlit process.
- **Page bundles** run in a sidecar Streamlit process and are embedded back into
  the UI (so they feel like first-class pages).

Enabling bundles (per project)
------------------------------

Bundles are enabled per project by writing their module names into
``app_settings.toml``:

.. code-block:: toml

   [pages]
   view_module = ["view_maps_network", "view_barycentric"]

You can edit this manually (Edit → APP-SETTINGS) or use Explore → Configure,
which writes the same list for you.
