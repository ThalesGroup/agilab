▶️ APPS PAGES
==============

Introduction
------------
Apps pages host Streamlit utilities that are independent of any single
application. You can decide which pages are available to a project by editing
``[pages]`` in ``app_settings.toml`` or by using the Explore page. A bundle is
discovered when its directory under ``${AGILAB_PAGES_ABS}`` contains a
``pyproject.toml`` that points at ``src/<module>/<module>.py``; keep a dedicated
``.venv`` nearby if you need custom dependencies—the Explore launcher will spin
it up automatically.

Built-in vs Plugin Pages
------------------------
- **Built-in pages** (Edit, Execute, Experiment, Explore) ship with AGILab. They
  live in the IDE itself, always appear in the navigation sidebar and update
  whenever you upgrade the core project.
- **Plugin pages** live under ``src/agilab/apps-pages`` (or your private clone).
  Each bundle adds Streamlit views that load side-by-side with the built-in
  pages. Projects enable them by listing the page module in ``app_settings.toml``
  or via Explore → Configure.
- Built-in flows remain available even when no plugin pages are installed. When
  plugins are present, Explore surfaces both sets so users can jump between core
  workflows and custom dashboards.

Sidebar
-------
- Project selector: switch between installed applications.
- Multi-select of available page bundles (persisted per project).

Main Content Area

- Launch a page in a dedicated sidecar session for interactive work.

See also **EDIT → APP-SETTINGS → File Editor** to review the ``[pages]`` entry
that Explore updates.
