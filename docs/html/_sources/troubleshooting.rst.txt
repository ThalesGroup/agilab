Troubleshooting
===============


A - Prerequisite:
-----------------

Run agilab.sh to install and then try to run your xxx-project.
Each Agilab API call should be set with verbose mode >= 3. In particular, when debugging with a Dask worker,
it will create a file (~/xxx-project_trace.txt) that shows what happened in during the worker build execution.

B - Pycharm Run/Debug configurations:
-------------------------------------

These scripts are provided to debug your app with the PyCharm IDE, which best matches Agilab troubleshooting.

.. include:: troubleshooting.txt
   :code: text

C - Exemple of Tests Sequence:
----------------------

- ** zip-all gen**

  TGenerate the zip of the whole agi project directory with .gitignore filtration. A agi.zip file should created at the root dir of your projectu

- ** test-agi-env test**

  This will lunch unitary test for agi_env components and display their pytest results

- ** core test**

  This will lunch all the unitary tests for agi_core components and display their pytest results

- ** app_script gen**

  This will generate the script below

- ** <your app>-preinstall**

  This will test the conversion of <your_code>_worker.py into <your_code>_worker.pyx to check if your code is transformable into Cython compilable source code.
  A file <your_code_worker.pyx> should appear in your wenv

- ** <your app>-postinstall test**

  This will test the test your worker post_install.py.

- ** app-manager install**

  This will install the venv in your fwk/apps/<your app>.

- ** app install**

  This will install the venv in your fwk/apps/<your app> and in your <home>/wenv/<your worker>.

- ** <your app>_egg gen **

  Generate your project egg file containing all the required files to compile the worker Cython library.

- ** <your app>_lib gen **

  Generate your project lib file by compiling <your_code>_worker.pyx and add its dependencies into a Cython library.

- ** <your app> test**

  This will test your app in a minimalistic way.

- ** <your app>  run**

  In the contexte of  apps/<your app>/.venv it will run the log/AGI.<snippet> you have selected which should only be a distribute or a run one.
  Remark: use script "app install" to test your app install as it has to be run under fwk/core/.venv virtual environnement.

D - agilab_run_dev vs agilab_run_enduser vs lab_run:
--------------------------

- **1. agilab_run_dev and agilab_run_enduser**

  Main script to lunch agilab in mode dev or in mode enduser
  This will run streamlit module which will run AGILAB.py in run/debug mode

- **12. lab_run_test**

  Only for enabling lab_run.py debugging
  This will directly lunch run_lab.py in run/debug mode

Known Bugs
==========

<install.sh> freeze:
--------------------
When you run install.sh it may looks like it is freezed at some point.
"Installing agi-cluster...
uv --preview-features extra-build-dependencies sync -p 3.xx.xx --dev
Using CPython 3.xx.xx
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Resolved xxx packages in xxms
   Building agi-cluster @ file:///Users/example/agilab/src/agilab/core/agi-cluster"

The sync keeps “freezing” because uv still has to build some heavy dependencies (most notably numba/llvmlite) from
  source. Those wheels are only pre-built for a few Python versions; with 3.13 they do not exist yet, and even on
  3.12 they can fall back to a full compile that takes many minutes before any log progress appears.
Unfortunatly when NumPy/Numba falls back to compiling from source you won’t see messages until the compiler finishes, so it
  looks like the run “hung”.

<UV> VIRTUAL_ENV Warning
------------------------

while running uv into a project from another one:
warning: `VIRTUAL_ENV=.venv` does not match the project environment path `/Users/example/agilab/src/agilab/apps/mycode_project/.venv` and will be ignored; use `--active` to target the active environment instead
This is not a problem this because we dynamically change the venv. Just ignore it.

<UV> Sync Failed
----------------

While running a script you see a "missing module" message but your module is correctly installed in your venv. And when
you try to reinstall it his can lead to re-installation failures due to `circular dependencies` that prevent proper
package version resolution. This may arrived because your `UV cache has been corrupted`.

**Solution:**

Clean the UV cache by executing the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv cache clean


<DASK> Debug Issue
------------------

While debugging Dask on Python, you might encounter the following error:

.. code-block:: none

   TypeError: _patch_asyncio.<locals>.run() got an unexpected keyword argument 'loop_factory'

**Workaround:**

Disable `python.debug.asyncio.repl` in the PyCharm registry.
To do this, go to Naviguate/Search Everywhere (`<Shift>+<Ctrl|command>+A`) to open the `<Action>` tab then search for *registry*.

<PYCHARM> Run/Debug Configuration is Broken
-------------------------------------------

For instance, select your "Run/Debug configuration" (e.g., `<gen-docstings>`) and then press [Run].
The following message appears when you try to [debug] `<gen-docstings>`:

   Argument for @NotNull parameter 'module' of com/intellij/openapi/roots/ModuleRootManager.getInstance must not be null

.. image:: diagrams/pycharm_bug.png
   :width: 400
   :alt: PyCharm Bug
   :align: center

.. raw:: html

   <br><br>

**Solution:**

This is because your Pycharm script is pointing an a venv but the project containing this venv is not attach to your current project.
So you have to attach this project to your currrent project for enabling your script to be runnable again.


<PYCHARM> Can't open your project
---------------------------------
After an install of agilab when you select your project to open but it failed.
This might come from pycharm/setup-pycharm.sh that have corrupted your pycharm settings

**Solution (macOS):**

# remove caches and index
rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/JetBrains/PyCharm*

# remove locks / and broken files
find ~/Library/Application\ Support/JetBrains -maxdepth 2 -type f -name '*.lock' -delete
rm -f  ~/Library/Application\ Support/JetBrains/PyCharm*/options/recentProjects.xml
rm -f  ~/Library/Application\ Support/JetBrains/PyCharm*/options/other.xml.___jb_tmp___
rm -f  ~/Library/Application\ Support/JetBrains/PyCharm*/options/jdk.table.xml
rm -f  ~/Library/Application\ Support/JetBrains/PyCharm*/options/jdk.table.xml.___jb_tmp___


Failed to read pydantic metadata
--------------------------------

If the installer emits ``Failed to read metadata from installed package pydantic==2.12.3``:

1. Clear the offending wheel::

       uv cache clean pydantic

2. Reinstall ``pydantic`` in each affected project::

       cd src\agilab\core\agi-env
       uv pip install --no-cache-dir --force-reinstall pydantic==2.12.3
       cd ..\agi-node
       uv pip install --no-cache-dir --force-reinstall pydantic==2.12.3
       cd ..\agi-cluster
       uv pip install --no-cache-dir --force-reinstall pydantic==2.12.3

3. Rerun the installer.

The METADATA files are regenerated and the warning disappears.
