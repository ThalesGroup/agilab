agi-node API
============

Path handling
-------------
Workers resolve any dataset or workspace URI through
``BaseWorker.normalize_data_uri`` before touching the filesystem. The helper
accepts ``str`` or ``pathlib.Path`` inputs and normalises them as follows:

- UNC-style shares on Windows (for example ``\\server\share``) are preserved
  by wrapping them in ``PureWindowsPath`` and returning the
  ``os.path.normpath`` representation so network drives keep their double
  backslashes.
- Every other value is first joined against ``env.agi_share_path_abs`` when the
  environment exposes one; otherwise the helper falls back to the current home
  directory. This lets configuration files ship entries such as
  ``example_app/dataset`` while still resolving to the correct worker share
  (``/Users/example/clustershare/example_app/dataset`` on macOS, the mounted
  share on Linux remotes, and so on).
- ``Path.resolve(strict=False)`` is applied to keep symlinks or bind mounts
  created by installers while still accepting directories that are created
  later during the run.
- On non-managed Windows installs the helper also attempts to map the dataset
  under ``\\127.0.0.1\…`` via ``net use`` so local workers gain access to the
  same share paths used on Linux.
- The function emits POSIX-style strings on Unix-like systems and uses
  ``os.path.normpath`` on Windows so downstream code can hand the value to shell
  commands or ``pathlib`` without further tweaks.

All built-in workers, including ``flight_worker`` and ``mycode_worker``, call
this helper in ``start`` and ``work_pool`` to populate ``self.args.data_uri``
and any per-file path passed to the pool. Extending these workers means you get
consistent path semantics across local and distributed executions without
copy-pasting platform-specific logic.


Argument helpers
----------------

Recent updates to ``BaseWorker`` standardise how workers load, merge, and persist
their argument models. Every subclass can opt into the following hooks:

- ``default_settings_path`` and ``default_settings_section`` control the TOML
  source used by ``from_toml`` / ``to_toml``.
- ``args_loader`` and ``args_merger`` are callables that fetch and combine raw
  settings with user overrides before instantiating the worker.
- ``args_ensure_defaults`` lets workers patch derived values (for example,
  normalising paths) after the merge but before instantiation.
- ``args_dumper`` and ``args_dump_mode`` define how ``to_toml`` emits the active
  configuration, enabling round-trips back into ``app_settings.toml``.

If these helpers live in the worker module (for example ``load_args`` or
``dump_args`` defined alongside the class) or inside a sibling ``*_args``/``app_args``
module, ``BaseWorker`` auto-binds them during class creation. That lets most apps
drop the explicit ``args_loader = …`` boilerplate while still allowing manual
overrides for custom integrations.

Managed PC path remapping
-------------------------

- ``managed_pc_path_fields`` lists argument attributes that should be remapped to
  the managed-machine workspace (``~/MyApp`` by default) when ``AgiEnv`` reports a
  managed PC.
- ``managed_pc_home_suffix`` customises the managed workspace folder name if your
  deployment uses something other than ``MyApp``.
- ``BaseWorker.from_toml`` applies the remapping automatically; when instantiating
  a worker manually, use ``setup_args`` to apply defaults and remap paths in a
  single call.
- ``setup_args`` optionally accepts ``output_field`` (e.g. ``"data_uri"``) along with
  ``output_subdir``, ``output_attr``, ``output_clean`` and ``output_parents_up`` so
  managers can prepare their output directories without repeating boilerplate.

Output directory helpers
------------------------

- ``prepare_output_dir`` centralises the setup of manager-side output folders
  (defaulting to ``dataframe``). Hand it the base path you want to target and it
  normalises the path, clears old contents when ``auto_clean_data_out`` is enabled,
  creates the directory, and stores it on ``self.data_out`` unless you override the
  target attribute.

With these attributes in place, ``BaseWorker.from_toml`` produces a configured
instance and ``BaseWorker.to_toml`` writes the updated schema without each app
copying boilerplate. ``BaseWorker.as_dict`` exposes a serialisable payload for
Streamlit pages and API consumers, while ``_extend_payload`` stays available for
apps that need to enrich the exported structure.
