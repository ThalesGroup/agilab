▶️ PAGES (AGILAB.py)
===================

AGILAB.py is the Streamlit entry point. In the UI, everything you navigate to is
presented as a *page*:

- **Core pages** run inside the main Streamlit process (Home, Edit, Execute,
  Experiment, Explore).
- **Page bundles** are optional dashboards launched in a sidecar Streamlit
  process and embedded back into the UI.

Core pages
----------

- :doc:`edit-help` — inspect and modify project sources and settings.
- :doc:`execute-help` — install workers, generate distributions, and run pipelines.
- :doc:`experiment-help` — iterate in ``lab_steps.toml`` and run snippets against exported data.
- :doc:`explore-help` — discover, configure, and launch page bundles.

Page bundles
------------

A page bundle is a small Streamlit project stored on disk and launched on
demand:

- It lives under ``${AGILAB_PAGES_ABS}`` (default: ``src/agilab/apps-pages``).
- It is discovered when the directory contains a ``pyproject.toml`` whose entry
  point is ``src/<module>/<module>.py``.
- It can ship its own ``.venv`` (or ``venv``); otherwise Explore falls back to the
  shared locations referenced by ``AGILAB_VENVS_ABS`` and
  ``AGILAB_PAGES_VENVS_ABS``.

Enable bundles (per project)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Enable bundles by listing their module names in ``app_settings.toml``:

.. code-block:: toml

   [pages]
   view_module = ["view_maps_network", "view_barycentric"]

You can edit this manually (Edit → APP-SETTINGS) or use Explore → Configure,
which writes the same list for you.

Included page bundles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- ``view_autoencoder_latenspace`` — autoencoder-powered dimensionality reduction.
- ``view_barycentric`` — barycentric simplex visualisation for KPI proportions.
- ``view_maps`` — 2D map viewer for geolocated datasets.
- ``view_maps_3d`` — 3D cartography view (Deck.gl) with optional overlays.
- ``view_maps_network`` — topology viewer synchronised with geographic views.

See also
--------

- :doc:`architecture` for the end-to-end pipeline view.
- :doc:`learning-workflows` for training vs inference (and optional continuous/federated patterns).
