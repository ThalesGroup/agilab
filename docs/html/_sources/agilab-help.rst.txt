▶️ HOME (AGILAB.py)
===================

AGILAB.py is the main Streamlit entry point. It provides a single navigation
surface for:

- **Core pages** (Home, Edit, Execute, Experiment, Explore), and
- **Page bundles** (optional dashboards launched from Explore).

How pages are presented
-----------------------

- Core pages and page bundles both appear as “pages” in the UI, with a consistent
  layout and navigation.
- The key difference is runtime: core pages run inside the main Streamlit app,
  while page bundles run in a sidecar Streamlit process and are embedded back
  into the UI.

Core pages
----------

- :doc:`edit-help` — inspect and modify project sources and settings.
- :doc:`execute-help` — install workers, generate distributions, and run pipelines.
- :doc:`experiment-help` — iterate in ``lab_steps.toml`` and run snippets against exported data.
- :doc:`explore-help` — discover, configure, and launch page bundles.

Page bundles (apps-pages)
-------------------------

Page bundles are optional Streamlit dashboards stored under ``${AGILAB_PAGES_ABS}``
(default: ``src/agilab/apps-pages``). They are enabled per project via
``[pages].view_module`` in ``app_settings.toml``.
