Introduction
============

Overview
--------
Building robust models from data requires close collaboration between domain experts and data scientists. Once the algorithm is trained, the process becomes similar to standard engineering activities.

AGILab is a multi-project data science solution designed to manage projects using template-based frameworks. It also serves as a first step towards an experimental Python IDE for data science applied to engineering.

**Remark**: Historically, AGILab was developed as a playground for ``agi-core``.
If you only need cluster automation, you can use ``agi-core`` directly (for
example from a notebook) without the Streamlit user interface.

**Purpose**
-----------
AGILab aims to enhance data science productivity

- **Cross-Functional Collaboration in Data Science:**
  Provide project templates plus import/export and cloning workflows to promote
  **code reuse** across teams.

- **Enhance Agility in AI Projects:**
  Provide **scalability** for both data and execution so you do not need to
  rework your code as datasets grow.
  Provide built-in online and offline **generative AI** helpers to assist
  algorithm exploration and coding assistance (prompt engineering).

- **Overcome IT Constraints:**
  Automate deployment on local or SSH clusters so you can run workloads at
  scale without bespoke DevOps workflows.

**Target Audience**
-------------------
AGILab is intended for professionals and domain experts, offering a tool that simplifies AI project development.

**Main Dependencies**
------------------------

- `uv <https://docs.astral.sh/uv/>`_: Advanced utilities to manage Python virtual environments.
- `asyncssh <https://asyncssh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/AsyncSSH>`_: Enabling SSHv2 protocol on top of the Python asyncio framework.
- `Cython <https://cython.org/>`_: Cython is an optimising static compiler for both the Python programming language and the extended Cython programming language (based on Pyrex). It makes writing C extensions for Python as easy as Python itself.
- `Dask <https://www.dask.org/>`_: Parallel computing for handling large datasets and computations.
- `Streamlit <https://streamlit.io/>`_: Rapidly develop and deploy interactive applications.
- `Pycharm <https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm>`_: Assist you for advanced code development with AGI.
- `OpenAI <https://chatgpt.com/#pricing>`_: Assist you for algorithm discovery and code generation.
- `Ollama (local) <https://ollama.com/>`_: Runs a local Ollama model (configurable; not limited to Mistral) for offline experimentation and code generation.
- `Universal Offline AI Chatbot (RAG) <https://github.com/ThalesGroup/universal-offline-ai-chatbot>`_: Optional offline document Q&A pipeline (PDF indexing + vector store) backed by a local Ollama model.
- `GPT-OSS Offline <https://gpt-oss.com>`_: Runs open-weight GPT-OSS responses locally so experimentation keeps working without external connectivity.
  Configure the assistant via the Streamlit sidebar or the `GPT_OSS_ENDPOINT` and `GPT_OSS_MODEL`
  environment variables (defaults to ``http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/responses`` and ``gpt-oss-120b``).

.. note::
   Windows builds are still catching up. Features that rely on local assistants—such as the GPT-OSS offline coding helper—are only partially supported while the port is in progress.

**Technologies Selection Criteria**
-----------------------------------

The selection of these technologies have been done for Portability, Simplicity and Performances:

- **Portability**: AGILab runs and shares environments across systems without
  the overhead of full virtualization.
- **Simplicity**: AGILab manages dependencies and isolates project environments,
  reducing conflicts.
- **Performance**: AGILab provides runtime benchmarks for combinations of
  Cython, Dask, and thread/process execution modes.


Example: Aircraft Radio Communication
-----------------------------------

- **Needs Algos Set**

Today, a single algorithm is rarely enough to solve complex problems. Instead, a suite of algorithms is needed to address diverse use cases with intricate implementations. For example, consider telecom systems in an aircraft:

   :align: center

This scenario requires reuse across organizations, infrastructure, and operating systems. While many consider virtualization and containerization (e.g., Docker) as the solution, AGILab offers an alternative.

AGILab is designed for modern development needs—reducing overhead, promoting collaboration, and simplifying the deployment pipeline without compromising on power or flexibility.

- **Needs Model of Models**

Since Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) has not yet been achieved with a single algorithm, a "model of models" is necessary. For instance, in aircraft radio communication, this approach is illustrated as follows:

AGILab provides a dynamic playground to experiment with various architectural solutions without reworking your code. This flexibility is achieved through two main mechanisms:

- A versatile GUI that allows selection from 16 different execution modes.
- A decoupling of software architecture from available hardware resources.
