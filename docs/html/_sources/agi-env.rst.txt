agi-env API
===========

This is a module share between core/agi-core and agilab to set all the path required by both

Usage Example
-------------

Instanciation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. literalinclude:: snippets/AgiEnv.instanciation.py
   :language: python


.. note::
   ``AgiEnv`` behaves as a singleton. Repeated instantiation updates the same
   environment instance; call :func:`AgiEnv.reset` before configuring a new
   environment, or :func:`AgiEnv.current` to access the active one.

Share directory resolution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``AgiEnv`` exposes the resolved data root through :pyattr:`env.agi_share_dir`.
The path is derived from ``AGI_CLUSTER_SHARE`` (or legacy ``AGI_SHARE_DIR``)
with ``AGI_LOCAL_SHARE`` as a fallback. The behaviour differs slightly
depending on where the environment runs:

* **Manager / developer shells** – relative inputs are expanded against
  :pyattr:`env.home_abs` and the directory is created eagerly. Any missing or
  read-only share will raise an error so operators can fix the mount point.
* **Remote workers** – the configured value remains relative (for example,
  ``clustershare/example_app``) and is not created automatically. Workers
  never fall back to per-user paths; instead the configured share path must be
  mounted and writable on the remote host. When an absolute path under
  ``/Users/<user>`` or ``/home/<user>`` is provided, the leading segments are
  stripped so the worker can re-root the remainder under its own home directory
  or mount point.

Because the worker value stays relative, it will fail fast if ``agi_share_dir``
is not mounted. This makes data provenance explicit and avoids hidden copies of
datasets on remote machines.
