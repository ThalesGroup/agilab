Licenses
========

There are two distinct license scopes to keep in mind when reading this documentation:

- **AGILab source code license**: defined by the repository root ``LICENSE`` (and any attributions in ``NOTICE``).
- **Vendored third-party assets**: if a file or submodule is copied into the repository, its license text may be shipped under ``LICENSES/``.

The pages below are **generated dependency inventories**. They list Python packages resolved from each component's
``pyproject.toml`` at documentation build time (via ``licensecheck``). This inventory can be broader than ``LICENSES/``
because it includes runtime dependencies, not only vendored source files.
