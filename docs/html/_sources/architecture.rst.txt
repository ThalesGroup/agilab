AGILab Architecture
===================

This page gives a single place to understand how the repository is organised,
which services collaborate at runtime, and where to hook in when building a new
app or extending the platform.

New to AGILab? Start with :doc:`quick-start` for a five-minute run-through, then
return here when you need the big picture of how the layers fit together.

   AGILab layers from the Streamlit front-end down to worker clusters.

Component view
--------------

.. figure:: diagrams/packages_agi_distributor.svg
   :alt: Package diagram generated from agi_cluster
   :width: 90%

   Pyreverse snapshot of how the Streamlit entry points, ``agi_core`` façade,
   ``agi_env`` and ``agi_cluster`` exchange data before the workers are started.

Pipeline example
----------------

.. figure:: diagrams/agilab_app_flow.png
   :alt: Pipeline example from trajectories and environment maps to visualisation
   :width: 100%

   Data flows from trajectory generators and environment maps into simulation
   stages, decision engines (learned and/or optimization baselines), and finally
   visualisation and KPI reporting.

AGILAB.py navigation
--------------------

.. figure:: diagrams/agilab_pages.png
   :alt: AGILAB.py Streamlit entry showing PAGES vs APPS-PAGES flows
   :width: 90%

   AGILAB.py exposes core PAGES (Execute/Explore/Edit) and APPS-PAGES for each
   app, all routed into ``agi_core`` for orchestration.

Manager vs worker responsibilities
----------------------------------

.. figure:: diagrams/app_manager_worker.png
   :alt: App manager orchestrates AGI.run; workers execute tasks
   :width: 90%

   An app manager prepares arguments and submits plans via ``AGI.run``; workers
   (BaseWorker subclasses) execute the distributed tasks.

Layers at a glance
------------------

.. list-table:: Layer responsibilities
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Layer / Code roots
     - What it does
   * - **User surfaces**
     - Streamlit pages (``src/agilab/pages``) plus CLI mirrors in
       ``src/agilab/examples`` and ``tools/run_configs``. They capture user
       intent and translate it into ``AGI.*`` calls.
   * - **agi_core**
     - Reusable widgets, telemetry, app loaders. Keeps Streamlit/CLI code thin
       and prepares ``WorkDispatcher`` manifests. See :doc:`agi-core-architecture`.
   * - **agi_env**
     - Discovers datasets, resolves symlinks, stages bundles in ``~/wenv`` and
       prepares environment variables. Every run builds an ``AgiEnv`` first.
   * - **agi_cluster / agi_node**
     - Scheduler, workers, balancer, SSH/zip helpers. Turns manifests into Dask
       jobs locally or on remote hosts.
   * - **Apps (``src/agilab/apps``)**
     - Project-specific logic. App managers describe ``build_distribution`` and
       worker arguments but rely on the shared layers above.
   * - **Workers (``~/wenv/<app>_worker``)**
     - Cythonised/packaged code deployed on cluster nodes.

**User surfaces**
    - Streamlit pages shipped in ``src/agilab/pages`` (EXECUTE/EXPLORE/EDIT/…).
    - CLI mirrors under ``docs/source/apps-pages`` and ``tools/run_configs``.
    - Example scripts in ``src/agilab/examples`` (kept in sync via
      ``pycharm/setup_pycharm.py``).

**Core services**
    - :doc:`agi-env` handles configuration, environment discovery, dataset
      staging and artifact caching. Every entry point constructs an ``AgiEnv``
      before touching a worker.
    - :doc:`agi-node` and :doc:`agi-distributor` package the reusable logic shared
      between all apps (dataset helpers, worker bootstrap, git/LFS utilities…).
    - :doc:`framework-api` exposes ``AGI.run`` / ``AGI.get_distrib`` /
      ``AGI.install`` orchestration.
    - Apps under ``src/agilab/apps`` stay isolated but consume the same base
      worker / dispatcher APIs. The repository includes example app templates
      such as ``mycode_project`` and ``flight_project``; additional templates can
      follow the same contract.

**Execution back-plane**
    - :doc:`agi-distributor` contains the Dask-based scheduler, worker templates and
      capacity balancer. Workers are packaged (``python -m agi_node…``) into
      ``~/wenv/<app>_worker`` before run time.
    - Optional cluster helpers (SSH, remote installs, zip staging) live under
      ``src/agilab/core/agi-node/agi_dispatcher`` and are reused by every app.

Runtime flow
------------

1. A run configuration (Streamlit button, CLI script, PyCharm run config) calls
   an example in ``src/agilab/examples/<app>/AGI_run_*.py``.
2. The script instantiates ``AgiEnv`` with the desired ``apps_dir`` and ``app``.
   ``AgiEnv`` resolves symlinks, copies optional data bundles and loads
   ``app_settings.toml`` overrides.
3. ``AGI.run`` (or ``AGI.get_distrib`` / ``AGI.install``) selects the dispatcher
   mode, builds or reuses the worker wheel, and starts a scheduler locally or on
   the configured SSH hosts.
4. :doc:`agi-distributor` spins up workers, streams ``WorkDispatcher`` plans derived
   from the app manager, and feeds telemetry back into the capacity predictor.
5. Results land in ``~/agi-space`` (for end users) or the repo ``data``/``export``
   folders (for developers), while logs are mirrored to
   ``~/log/execute/<app>/`` for reproducibility.

Two common execution modes:

- **Local notebook / laptop** – scheduler + workers run on the same machine.
  Use this for prototyping and keep an eye on ``~/log/execute/<app>/`` for
  telemetry.
- **Cluster / SSH hosts** – scheduler runs locally, workers spawn remotely via
  the SSH helpers in ``agi_cluster.agi_distributor``. Provide credentials via
  ``~/.agilab/.env`` and rerun ``pycharm/setup_pycharm.py`` after editing run
  configurations so CLI wrappers stay synced.

Core vs optional apps
---------------------

.. figure:: diagrams/repo_split.png
   :alt: Repository split between AGILAB core and optional apps
   :width: 90%

   AGILAB (open-source framework) underpins optional apps that can be installed
   separately. Public docs only cover the open-source layers and built-in apps.

Documentation map
-----------------

- :doc:`quick-start` – install/run instructions and links to sample commands.
- :doc:`introduction` – background, motivation, and terminology.
- :doc:`agi-core-architecture` – internals of the Streamlit/CLI façade.
- :doc:`framework-api` – reference for ``AGI.run`` and the dispatcher helpers.
