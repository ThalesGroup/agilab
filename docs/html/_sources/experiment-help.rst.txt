-------
- ``Lab Directory``: choose the module whose lab artefacts you want to work on.
  The selection points at ``${AGILAB_EXPORT_ABS}/<module>`` and initialises
  ``lab_steps.toml`` if it does not exist yet.
- ``Steps``: pick the ``lab_steps`` file relative to the export directory. When
  you change the selection the assistant reloads the stored conversation.
- ``DataFrame``: select which CSV (or parquet) is mounted for the assistant. The
  resolved absolute path lives under ``${AGILAB_EXPORT_ABS}``.
- ``Import Notebook``: upload an ``.ipynb`` file to seed the conversation when
  working offline.
- ``Open MLflow UI``: launches the MLflow dashboard in a new browser tab once
  ``activate_mlflow`` has started the local tracking server.

   .. tab-item:: ASSISTANT

      Each lab is organised as a sequence of steps stored in ``lab_steps.toml``.
      The numbered buttons at the top let you jump between them. Ask questions or
      describe transformations in the text area—AGILab forwards the prompt to the
      Responses API together with the selected DataFrame metadata. The code editor
      reacts to the toolbar actions:

      * ``Save`` keeps the snippet as-is in the current step.
      * ``Next`` persists the snippet and advances to a fresh step.
      * ``Remove`` deletes the step from ``lab_steps.toml``.
      * ``Run`` writes the snippet to ``lab_snippet.py``, executes it and stores any
        produced dataframe under ``lab_export_out.csv`` so the preview and the
        Execute/Explore pages can consume the result.

      The assistant automatically reloads the most recent dataframe and shows it below
      the editor. If nothing has been saved yet, you will see a reminder to run a
      snippet first.

   .. tab-item:: HISTORY

      Inspect or tweak the raw ``lab_steps.toml`` via the code editor. Saving the
      file here immediately refreshes the assistant tab.
