▶️ PAGE BUNDLES
===============

AGILab can optionally launch **page bundles** (sometimes called “apps-pages”):
standalone Streamlit dashboards that complement the built-in workflow pages.

In the UI, page bundles are presented the same way as core pages, but they run
in their own sidecar Streamlit process and are embedded back into the main app.

What is a page bundle?
----------------------

A page bundle is a small Streamlit project stored on disk and launched on demand
in its own Python interpreter:

- It lives under ``${AGILAB_PAGES_ABS}`` (default: ``src/agilab/apps-pages``).
- It is discovered when the directory contains a ``pyproject.toml`` whose entry
  point is ``src/<module>/<module>.py``.
- It can ship its own ``.venv`` (or ``venv``); otherwise Explore will fall back
  to the shared locations referenced by ``AGILAB_VENVS_ABS`` and
  ``AGILAB_PAGES_VENVS_ABS``.

Enabling bundles (per project)
------------------------------

Bundles are enabled per project by writing their module names into
``app_settings.toml``:

.. code-block:: toml

   [pages]
   view_module = ["view_maps_network", "view_barycentric"]

You can edit this manually (Edit → APP-SETTINGS) or use Explore → Configure,
which writes the same list for you.

Included page bundles
---------------------

This page lists the page bundles shipped with the repository. You can discover
and launch them from :doc:`explore-help`.

view_autoencoder_latenspace
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Autoencoder-powered dimensionality reduction.

- Input: exported dataframe (typically created in Execute).
- Output: latent-space plots, with colouring and train/test controls.

view_barycentric
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Barycentric simplex visualisation for KPI-style features that sum to 1.

- Input: dataframe with aggregated proportion columns.
- Output: interactive simplex plot for relative contributions.

view_maps
^^^^^^^^^

2D map viewer for geolocated datasets.

- Input: CSV/parquet with latitude/longitude columns.
- Output: interactive map with sampling, palette, and basemap controls.

view_maps_3d
^^^^^^^^^^^^

3D cartography view (Deck.gl) with optional overlays.

- Input: one or more geolocated datasets.
- Output: 3D map with extrusion/colour controls and layer toggles.

view_maps_network
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Network topology viewer synchronised with geographic views.

- Input: node positions + link definitions in the dataset.
- Output: map + graph views to inspect connectivity, link types, and snapshots.
