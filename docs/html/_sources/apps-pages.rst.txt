▶️ PAGE BUNDLE CATALOG
======================

This page lists the page bundles shipped with the repository. A page bundle is a
standalone Streamlit dashboard that you can discover and launch from Explore.

To enable a bundle for a given project, add its module name under
``[pages].view_module`` in ``app_settings.toml`` (or use Explore → Configure).
See :doc:`apps-pages-help` for the full “how it works” overview.
