===========

This page aggregates quick navigation links and reminders for the four primary AGILab pages:

- :ref:`edit_help`
- :ref:`execute_help`
- :ref:`experiment_help`
- :ref:`explore_help`

Each section explains the core workflows, keyboard shortcuts, and troubleshooting tips that the UI surfaces. Use this landing page as a starting point when orienting new operators or when you need the high-level overview before diving into the page-specific docs.
