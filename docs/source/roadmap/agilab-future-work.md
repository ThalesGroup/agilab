# AGILab future work

This note merges three roadmap axes that came out of recent AGILab design
discussions:

- Streamlit-inspired AGILab views
- Backend observability and audit architecture
- Connectors and integration

The goal is to make the next high-value choices explicit and easy to rank.

## Streamlit-inspired AGILab views

The most promising Streamlit-style view patterns for AGILab are not generic
gallery clones. They are focused application views that reinforce AGILab's core
value: orchestration, evidence, and domain-specific interaction.

### 1. Experiment Cockpit

Purpose:

- compare runs quickly
- inspect KPI summaries
- open artefacts and benchmark results from one page

Suggested layout:

- KPI cards on top
- run filters and selectors on the left
- comparison charts in the center
- run table and artefact links below

Why it matters:

- best value-to-effort ratio
- directly useful across many AGILab apps

### 2. Evidence / Release View

Purpose:

- decide whether a run, model, or artefact bundle is promotable

Suggested layout:

- release decision banner
- pass/fail gate checklist
- baseline vs candidate KPI comparison
- provenance and reproducibility panel
- evidence bundle table

Why it matters:

- strong differentiator for AGILab
- aligns with evidence-driven engineering and promotion workflows

### 3. Scenario Playback View

Purpose:

- replay a run over time
- inspect state, actions, and KPI evolution together

Suggested layout:

- run selector and time slider
- map or network panel
- current decision-state panel
- KPI timeline and event log

Why it matters:

- strong demonstration value
- good fit with existing AGILab map/network views

## Backend observability and audit architecture

AGILab should keep application-specific interaction inside the product and move
generic observability, search, and fleet-level monitoring into tools designed
for that job.

### 1. Elastic or OpenSearch + Grafana

Best when:

- engineering operations and observability are the main priority

Good for:

- run health
- worker load
- step latency
- failures and alerts
- SLA-style monitoring

Why it matters:

- strongest near-term operational value
- clean split between AGILab interaction and backend observability

### 2. OpenSearch + OpenSearch Dashboards

Best when:

- auditability, search, and historical traceability are the main priority

Good for:

- log exploration
- artefact traceability
- historical run search
- saved audit dashboards

Why it matters:

- lowest friction for Kibana-like usage patterns

### 3. Postgres + Superset

Best when:

- structured KPI analytics and management reporting are the main priority

Good for:

- curated dashboards
- cross-project reporting
- evidence trend analysis
- management-facing analytics

Why it matters:

- stronger fit than Elastic-native tools for BI-style reporting

## Connectors and integration

Connectors should appear explicitly in the roadmap because they are not just
implementation detail. They determine how AGILab reaches external systems,
resolves artefacts, and keeps app workflows portable.

### 1. Connector framework hardening

Purpose:

- make connector-backed workflows more predictable and portable

Focus areas:

- path portability
- artefact resolution
- stable source and target contracts
- less app-specific path glue
- clearer connector diagnostics

Why it matters:

- reduces friction across apps
- makes automation more reusable
- lowers the gap between conceptual workflows and executable steps

### 2. External system connectors

Purpose:

- connect AGILab cleanly to external systems and storage backends

Typical targets:

- Elasticsearch or OpenSearch
- object storage
- GitHub or GitLab
- simulation backends
- shared data repositories

Why it matters:

- expands AGILab beyond local file-driven workflows
- makes observability, reporting, and traceability easier to industrialize

### 3. Connector-aware views

Purpose:

- expose connector state and connector-derived provenance directly in the UI

Typical views:

- import or export provenance panel
- connector health/status panel
- external artefact traceability panel

Why it matters:

- makes integrations visible and debuggable
- gives users confidence about what data came from where

## Decision guidance

Use this rule of thumb:

- choose **Experiment Cockpit** if the next need is better daily usability for
  engineers comparing runs
- choose **Evidence / Release View** if the next need is promotion readiness and
  defensible evidence
- choose **Scenario Playback View** if the next need is time-based explanation
  and demonstration
- choose **Elastic/OpenSearch + Grafana** if the next need is operations and
  observability
- choose **OpenSearch + OpenSearch Dashboards** if the next need is audit and
  historical search
- choose **Postgres + Superset** if the next need is curated KPI analytics
- choose **Connector framework hardening and external integrations** if the next
  need is portability, external system access, and reliable artefact flow

## Final consolidated poll

The poll is routed through GitHub issues in the canonical repository.

- Submit a vote: <https://github.com/ThalesGroup/agilab/issues/new?template=roadmap-vote.yml>
- Browse submitted votes: <https://github.com/ThalesGroup/agilab/issues?q=is%3Aissue+in%3Atitle+%22%5BRoadmap+vote%5D%22>

If the `roadmap` label is not visible yet in GitHub, the issue form still
works. The repository workflow will create or update that label on the next
successful run.

Available choices:

- Experiment Cockpit
- Evidence / Release View
- Scenario Playback View
- Elastic/OpenSearch + Grafana
- OpenSearch + OpenSearch Dashboards
- Postgres + Superset
- Connector framework hardening and external integrations
