# AGILAB Open Source Project

AGILAB is an integrated experimentation platform that helps data scientists and applied researchers prototype, validate,
and deliver AI/ML applications quickly. The project bundles a curated suite of ‚Äúagi-*‚Äù components (environment, node,
cluster, core libraries, and reference applications) that work together to provide:

- **Reproducible experimentation** with managed virtual environments, dependency tracking, and application templates.
- **Scalable execution** through local and distributed worker orchestration (agi-node / agi-cluster) that mirrors
  production-like topologies.
- **Rich tooling** including Streamlit-powered apps, notebooks, workflow automation, and coverage-guided CI pipelines.
- **Turn‚Äëkey examples** covering classical analytics and more advanced domains such as flight simulation, network traffic,
  industrial IoT, and optimization workloads.

The project is licensed under the [BSD 3-Clause License](https://github.com/ThalesGroup/agilab/blob/main/LICENSE) and is
maintained by the Thales Group with community contributions welcomed.

## Repository layout

The monorepo hosts several tightly-coupled packages:

| Package | Location | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `agilab` | `src/agilab` | Top-level Streamlit experience, tooling, and reference applications |
| `agi-env` | `src/agilab/core/agi-env` | Environment bootstrap, configuration helpers, and pagelib utilities |
| `agi-node` | `src/agilab/core/agi-node` | Local/remote worker orchestration and task dispatch |
| `agi-cluster` | `src/agilab/core/agi-cluster` | Multi-node coordination, distribution, and deployment helpers |
| `agi-core` | `src/agilab/core/agi-core` | Meta-package bundling the environment/node/cluster components |

Each package can be installed independently via `pip install <package-name>`, but the recommended path for development is
to clone this repository and use the provided scripts.

## Quick start (developer mode)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ThalesGroup/agilab.git
cd agilab
./install.sh --install-apps --test-apps
streamlit run src/agilab/AGILAB.py
```

The installer uses [Astral‚Äôs uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) to provision isolated Python interpreters, set up
required credentials, run tests with coverage, and link bundled applications into the local workspace.

See the [documentation](https://thalesgroup.github.io/agilab) for alternative installation modes (PyPI/TestPyPI) and end
user deployment instructions.
